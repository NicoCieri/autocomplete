# Autocomplete

A small React app with an autocomplete field for searching Github Repositories.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NicoCieri/autocomplete.git
```

2. Navigate to the project's directory:

```bash
cd autocomplete
```

3. Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server and you can access your application at **http://localhost:3000**.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production, run the following command:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will generate optimized and minified production-ready files in the `dist` directory.

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
yarn test
```

This will execute the test cases and provide the test results.

You can also run the tests in watch mode:

```bash
test:watch
```

### Additional Scripts

- `yarn lint`: Run the linter to check for code style and formatting issues.
- `yarn preview`: Run a local static web server that serves the files from dist.
